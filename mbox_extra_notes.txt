That’s a pretty neat idea.  Those are some good ideas you have so far.   There’s a couple of logos that I can think of.  Something from the Oklahoma or Texas Panhandle might be an idea.  A windmill or a bluff near Palo Duro Canyon.   A silhouette of a windmill or a southwest canyon sunset.  A cactus, Ghost Ranch or Santa Fe, Union Pacific or Burlington RR.
