project: Montie stationery box
sheets are custom cut from regular letter size, 4 sheets per page

Letter size is 8.5 x 11, or 216 x 279 mm, so
the little sheets would be 
105 x 140 mm.

For a little forgiveness in cutting, to store a pen alongside, and to get the sheets out gracefully, the box bottom interior could be 20% bigger each dimension, or 
126 x 168 mm.

So try 126 x 168 x 60 height. Not enough room for the mini-sheets.

So try 140 x 176 x 40 height.


Faces of cube are decorated with “panels” of artwork. Top face has the cutout to extract the sheets, so it has no panel, maybe only a small logo “MB”.

Artwork Panels:
Top:		none
Front:		Montie Bowen -or- Dad’s Notes
Left side:	Jayhawk, KU letters, “Lawrence, KS”
Right side:	
Back:		
Bottom:	J. Bowen, 2015


Sheets:	Listen up	Montie says…
Then a horizontal rule.
